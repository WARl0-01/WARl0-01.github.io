        <p>Hi this is my website, it looks pretty bad, but it doesnt need to look nice. I also would have to refresh my HTML and CSS knowledge to make a compotent website, and I think this minimal page works much better imo in both effort and just anything i could do with effort.</p>

        <h3>My Practices</h3>
        <p>All switch lubing uses Kyrtox 205g0 unless it is tactile, which I haven't done yet. Stabilizers will always be lubed with dielectric grease on the wires and Teflon Grease on the housings.</p>
        <p>Oh and check here for some of my <a href="builds for other people.html">builds for other people</a>.</p>

        <h2>Pens</h2>
        <p>I'm not much into pens, but if you're interested, im wirting with a 'Karas Customs' <a href="https://karaskustoms.com/product/fountain-k-v2/">Fountain K</a> (all brass) pen. I'm using a 076 fine point steel 'Block' knib. For ink i'm currently using the '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AEUWPF4">たけ-すみ</a>' (take-sumi) ink made by pilot, it's a charcoal based ink.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was using a random compatibile pen body that fit a 
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Space-Pen-Pressurized-SPR4B/dp/B000FTGCFI">Fisher Space Pen refill</a> (pressurized ballpoint.) The refill has a parker style refil adapter and so I just slapped it into whatever pen worked. It's a decent refill, although insanely expensive. I've had issues with it writing poor in the past despite having a lot of ink left, and the fountain pen I use skips wayyyy less, and ink customization and quality is much higher.</p>

        <h2>Knives</h2>
        <p>Currently carrying a civvie damascus Elementum, its pretty nice, good steel, nice factoy edge and some gorgous looks honestly.</p>
        
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>I mean yeah thats what I'm here for in the first place. I do a decent job. Rn I got one project over here on github, and its for a RedditUnsave bot that unsaves your posts. Just made it because I couldn't find one. Its pretty bad, and it doesnt try to not get rate limited, as well as it missing like 2 key features (in my opinion,) but I think its good, at least better then what I initially shipped it out with.</p>
